# weather-mate

This assignment from The Odin Project is designed to test students' recently acquired knowledge of promises, APIs and async/await.  

Users may search for a location using and receive a relevant weather forecast.  The user may also select their preferred temperature unit.

Special note: Because I'm using publicly available API keys, I'm not concerned with their exposure.  Future Odin Project lessons will focus on securely handling API keys.
